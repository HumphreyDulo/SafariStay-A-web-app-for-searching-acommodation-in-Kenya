## 1. Introduction

This web application is a comprehensive platform that aims to enhance the accessibility and convenience of tourism in Kenya. The website provides a centralized resource for tourists and potential visitors to access reliable and up-to-date information about different tourist destinations, activities, accommodations, and transport options in Kenya. It addresses the challenges faced by tourists in finding comprehensive information and promotes transparency and convenience in booking accommodations and tour packages.

### Background Information

The tourism sector in Kenya plays a vital role in the country's economy. Despite the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the tourism sector has shown significant recovery, with increased international tourist arrivals and growth in inbound receipts. To rejuvenate the tourism industry, the Ministry of Tourism, Wildlife and Heritage has outlined strategies to enhance performance, develop niche products, and promote affordable and accessible travel. The private sector also plays a crucial role in promoting tourism by providing visibility and accessibility to tourist facilities.

### Problem Statement

The lack of a centralized platform with comprehensive and trustworthy information about tourist facilities in Kenya hinders tourists from accessing reliable details and creates challenges for tourism businesses to reach potential customers. There is a need for a website that serves as a one-stop-shop for Kenyan tourism needs, providing reliable information and facilitating bookings.

### Objectives

- Analyze existing applications and identify the problems faced by current systems
- Design a web platform specifically for searching tourist sites and facilities in Kenya
- Track user's booking information and generate reports
- Test and validate the application

## 2. Installation

### 2.1 Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure that you have the following software installed on your machine:
- XAMPP (for Apache, PHP, and MySQL)
- Git
- Composer
- Stripe for payment integration

### 2.2 Setting up the Environment
1. Install XAMPP by following the instructions on the official XAMPP website: [https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
2. Start the Apache and MySQL services in XAMPP control panel.

### 2.3 Clone the Repository
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. Run the following command to clone the repository:
   ```terminal
   git clone [https://github.com/HumphreyDulo/https---github.com-HumphreyDulo-Kihanya-Mungai-CS1.git]
   ```

### 2.4 Database Setup
1. Access the MySQL database through phpMyAdmin:
   - Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`
   - Click on the "New" button to create a new database.
   - Give the database a name (e.g., `home`) and click "Create".
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the following command to run the migrations and create the necessary tables:
   ```terminal
   php spark migrate
  
   


### 2.5 Configuring CodeIgniter
1. Open the project folder in a text editor.
2. Locate the `app/Config/Database.php` file.
3. Update the database configuration settings with your MySQL database credentials:
   ```php
   public $default = [
       'DSN'      => '',
       'hostname' => 'localhost',
       'username' => 'your_username',
       'password' => 'your_password',
       'database' => 'home',
       ...
   ];
   ```
   Replace `'your_username'` and `'your_password'` with your MySQL database credentials.

### 2.6 Running the Project
1. Start the Apache and MySQL services in XAMPP control panel, if they are not running.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the following command to start the CodeIgniter development server:

   php spark serve

By default, the server will run on 'http://localhost:8080'. If you want to run it on a different port, use the --port option followed by the desired port number (e.g., php spark serve --port=8000).
5. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8080 (or the specified port)

Please note that in the installation section, you need to replace `[repository_url]`, `'your_username'`, `'your_password'`, and `[path_to_repository]` with the actual values specific to your project and environment.


### 2.7 Installing stripe


Apologies for the confusion. The previous instructions were not in markdown format. Here are the steps to install Stripe in your project, including the necessary modifications to `php.ini`, in markdown language:

1. Create a Stripe Account: If you haven't already, sign up for a Stripe account at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com). Once you're signed up, you'll have access to your API keys, which you'll need to integrate Stripe into your project.

2. Download Composer: Composer is a dependency management tool for PHP. If you don't have Composer installed, download and install it by following the instructions at [getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

3. Create a New Project: Assuming you already have a PHP project set up, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project's directory.

4. Require Stripe Library: In your project's root directory, run the following command to require the Stripe PHP library:

   ```bash
   composer require stripe/stripe-php
   ```

   This command downloads the Stripe PHP library and adds it as a dependency to your project.

5. Configure PHP.ini: Open your `php.ini` file and ensure the following extensions are enabled:

   ```ini
   extension=curl
   extension=gd2
   ```

   Save the changes and restart your web server to apply the configuration.

6. Include Stripe Library: In your PHP file where you want to use Stripe, include the Stripe PHP library by adding the following line at the top:

   ```php
   require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
   ```

7. Set Your Stripe API Keys: In the same PHP file, replace `'your_publishable_key'` and `'your_secret_key'` with your actual Stripe API keys:

   ```php
   \Stripe\Stripe::setApiKey('your_secret_key');
   ```

   You can find your API keys in your Stripe account dashboard.

8. Start Using Stripe: With the Stripe PHP library installed and API keys configured, you can now start using Stripe's features in your PHP code. For example, to create a payment charge, you can use the following code:

   ```php
   $charge = \Stripe\Charge::create([
       'amount' => 2000, 
       'currency' => 'usd',
       'source' => 'tok_visa', // Replace with actual card token. tok_visa is a token for visa cards
       'description' => 'Example charge',
   ]);
   ```

   Customize the code according to your specific payment scenarios and requirements.

After that, you will have successfully installed Stripe in your PHP project. Remember to consult the official Stripe documentation for more detailed information and examples on how to use Stripe's features effectively.
